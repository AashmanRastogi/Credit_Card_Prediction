Credit cards play a vital role as indispensable tools that enable individuals to make significant purchases that would otherwise be impossible. For our project, we focused on studying credit card late fees by using personal characteristics of individuals. Our aim was to develop a predictive model that credit card companies can leverage to forecast whether a person will incur late fees based on their provided information. To achieve this, we thoroughly evaluated our dataset using a range of models to identify the most effective approach for predicting the likelihood of late fees. Through our analysis, we determined that the optimal model is a KNN model utilizing the Manhattan distance metric that considers 9 neighbors. This carefully crafted model exhibited an impressive accuracy of approximately 0.741, showcasing its potential for accurate predictions to help companies determine if a person should or should not be approved for a credit card.
